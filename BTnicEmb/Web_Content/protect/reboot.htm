<h1>Reboot In Progress...</h1>

<p>Your settings were successfully saved, and the board is now rebooting 
to configure itself with the new settings.</p>

<h3>Reconnection Instructions</h3>
	Use the Ethernet Discoverer to find BTnic devices on the local network.
	If you need to restore compile-time settings you can clear the board's EEPROM:
	<ol>
	<li>Connect	the RESET jumper momentarily to reboot the BTnic.</li>
	<li>Reconnect the RESET jumper during the four second bootloader process. The STATUS LED will turn to indicate the EEPROM is being cleared and will turn off when complete.</li>
	<li>Remove the RESET jumper. The board will boot with the restored factory default values.</li>
	</ol>
